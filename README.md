# ascii_elevation_profile

This is WIP!

It is code to create very simplified elevation profile out of a gpx-file. It only uses ascii charackters in on line.
Each symbol represents 250m in distance. The elevation diference depends on the gpx-file.

For example:

1. ..:::iiIIÎÎÎÎIiiiiiiiiiIÎÎIIIii::::::.................... [Example of a Hike in the Pyrenees] (https://www.outdooractive.com/de/route/wanderung/midi-pyrenees/pyrenees2018tag61/127256744/) 
2. ........................:::::::::::iiIIIIIIÎÎÎIIIIii:iiiiIIIIIIIIIIIÎÎÎÎÎÎIÎÎÎIIIIIIiiiiii:::::::i:::....... [Example of a biketrail] (https://www.outdooractive.com/de/route/mountainbike/schwarzwald/mountainbike-tour-auf-den-totenkopf-im-kaiserstuhl/6409788/)
